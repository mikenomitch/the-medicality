  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    The Medicality was founded by leaders who have spent their careers crafting white-glove experiences in ultra-luxury
    hotels and pioneering patient-centered care inside top-tier health systems. We believe that the same rigor that
    wins five-star guest loyalty can transform hospital stays into calm, reassuring experiences for patients and their
    families.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    We embed alongside your teams to align culture, operations, and service behaviors. By blending behavioral psychology
    with proven hospitality protocols, we build lasting systems that honor patients and employees as customers.
    Everything we do is measurable—from asset value and profitability to satisfaction scores, clinical outcomes, and
    team retention.
  </p>

  </ul>
